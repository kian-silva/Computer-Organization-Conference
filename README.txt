# Computer-Organization-Conference
For my conference project, the goal was for me to learn python. To learn python I was tasked with making various cyphers in python. The cyphers
implemented in this project are all very common cyphers in history. Prior to coding some of these cyphers I read 'The Code Book,' by Simon Singh,
This book taught me about the need and uses for cryptography. By the end of this semester I had written 5 different forms of classical cyphers along
with 2 different forms of decryption without the key. The first I had implemented was decryption via the use of frequency analysis on a shift cypher. 
The second is a method of decryption for the vigenere cypher without the key, the approach I had involved the encryption key being an english word in 
the dictionary and for the encryption to preserve spaces and punctuation. The rest of this decryption would attempt to decrypt the encrypted text with
every word in the dictionary and take that decryption and check to see if the words in the decryption are english words. This method takes a relatively
large amount of time to be performed, though it did not end up taking as long as expected. This method is apposed to the classical method of decrypting
the cypher without a key where you create an index of coincidence to determine the key length and using alternating combinations to determine the key 
and the rest of the message. Towards the end, I implemented the very beginings of the key creation for RSA crypto, though it would obviously require much
more to mimic RSA. Which is something that, had I had more time to investigate this project, I would have enjoyed learning more of and implementing myself.
Overall, I believe this project did the purpose of teaching me python and its various quirks to the point that I feel confident in my ability to use python
as a language for whatever future projects may come.
